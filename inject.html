    <p>Brine injection is selected as the basis for a "quick and dirty" project where an adaptive method will help achieve a more optimal addition of salt in particular. The project's duration confined to 3-4 month, this means that it is necessary to clearly deliminate the problem and make wide use of "hand held" solutions in order to quickly test the method.</p>
<h2>Process description</h2>
<p>Brine is added to a wide range of meats before packaging in order to mature, tenderize and enhance flavor. The brine consists of a mix of water and salt, phosphate, nitrate and in some cases sugar or other types of flavoring. Salt has the effect of increases the solubility of proteins and thereby improves the meats ability to retain water. However, if the salt concentration gets too high, the effect is reversed and the muscle fibers shrink and proteins risk getting washed out. For the best results, the brine should be uniformly distributed in the meat. This can be achieved by administering the brine externally or by injecting it directly into the meat. The salt will then diffuse through out the meat and distribute evenly with time through chemical processes. Salt is able to diffuse at the most 0.5 cm. per day, so if the brine needs to defuse over long distances, it becomes very time intensive and impractical. The standard practice for quickly curing meat is injection of brine using a grid of needles. When using current injection systems alone, the results are not always satisfactory and the meat is subjected to additional treatments both before and after the injection of brine. The meat's ability to absorb the brine can be improved by hammering before injection, this extends the muscle fibers, which increase room for brine and improves the distribution. </p>
<p>A repport "Accelereret saltning med multistiksprøjtning" [2] from the running DMRI project, "Optimeret produktion af forædlede kødprodukter" investigates the possibilities for reducing the time needed to salt pructs using existing equipment. The process can be helped along by treating the meat mechanically. Advanced machinery exisits for both injection and mechanical treatment, but no single manufactura provides a complete state-of-the-art solution and slaughterhouses largely rely on older outdated machinery. The goal of that part of the project is to reduce the process to under one day(7 hours). </p>
<p>The process can be be very complex when the natural variation and the many physical and chemical variables are taken into account. The main physical variables are: 
- Injection pattern
    * The denseness of the injection
    * The strategy for injecting brine, e.g. continously, when stationary, multiple times
- Meat texture
    * The xxx
- State of muscle fibers
    * The degree to which the fibers are prepared to absorbe the brine
- Brine injection pressure
- Injection speed/time
- Pressure at the point of injection
    * Depend on the flow through the other holes in the needle(s)
    * Holes maybe be blocked</p>
<p>Some of the most important chemical variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salt concentration<ul>
<li>Water retention increases with the concentration of salt </li>
<li>Very high salt concentrations reverses the effect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type of salt<ul>
<li>NaCl is significantly better than KCl at improving water retention</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sugar concentration<ul>
<li>Sugar has a similar effect to salt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phosphate concentration<ul>
<li>Phosphate increases the pH and water retention</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pH<ul>
<li>pH decides which ion, Na+ or Cl-, plays the primary role in increasing water retention</li>
<li>A pH value around 6 has shown to lead to optimal water retention for NaCl</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Temperature<ul>
<li>Low temperature contributes to better water retention, 4&deg; being optimal</li>
<li>High temperature speeds up the diffusion of salt through the meat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type of meat<ul>
<li>the amount of protein and the ratios between protein types, e.g. intracellular(soluble) and extracellular(non-soluble), differs between cuts</li>
<li>The pH differs between cuts, e.g. pork shoulder has a much higher pH than loin</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Initial experiment</h2>
<p>An initial experiment was conducted in order to investigate the effect of the two primary process parameters; brine pressure and injection speed, as well as determine the possibilities for visually measuring the gain using 3D sensing. The details of the experiment are described in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1raAamsBv-Zgsb5480L5EoHYvCk8Xo8ZGO3J60A4G6CI">multistiksprøjte eksperiment</a>.</p>
<h2>State-of-the-art</h2>
<h3>Meat preparation</h3>
<p>Some of the leading products for mechanical preparation of meat before injection of brine are:</p>
<h4>STEAKER/PRESSES by Günther (DE)</h4>
<h4>MACMAX by Schröder (DE):</h4>
<h5>TwinHammer 5500</h5>
<p>Pre-massaging unit that stretch the muscle fibers, which increase the space around fibrils. Leads to a reduction in the time needed for tumbling after injection.

<h3>Brine injection</h3>
<p>In the meat industry, brine is most commonly added using machines with multiple injection needles, the number of needles typically ranges from 40 to 500 with a spacing of 12-25 mm. Correct adjustment of the injector has a large impact on the time needed for the salt to properly diffuse. [3]</p>
<p>New needles that are thinner and have more holes</p>
<p>SPRAY PLUS
High pressure
Too much pressure?</p>
<h3>Tumbling</h3>
<p>The diffusion of salt is helped along by the use of mechanical tumbling, which quickly can distribute the salt up to 2 cm. [3]
The meat is gently tumbled, resulting in a massage of the meat that helps drain unabsorbed brine and thereby avoiding pockets of brine as well as closing up the holes that are left from the injection. </p>

<h4>Günther (DE)</h4>
<p>Spray Plus
Traditionally, brine is injected using needles with a few holes that has a diameter above 1 mm and a low brine pressure of a few bars. With the spray plus system, Günther introduces a spray system where the needles have many holes with a small diameter and a very high brine pressure. This reuslts in very fine droplets that should distribute well in the meat. Because of the much improved distribution of brine, the drip loss is reduced significantly. </p>
<p>The classical low presure injection technique:
<img alt="classic_needle_1_2" src="../images/injection/classic_needle_1_2.png"></p>
<p><em>(1) Brine injection from the start, (2) Spraying continous as the needles descend</em></p>
<p><img alt="classic_needle_3_4" src="../images/injection/classic_needle_3_4.png"></p>
<p><em>(3) Needles reach the bottom and leaves pockets of brine, (4) As the needles are withdrawn, brine collects in the holes</em></p>
<p><img alt="classic_needle_5" src="../images/injection/classic_needle_5.png"></p>
<p><em>(5) As the needles leave the meat, brine will escape</em></p>
<p>The new high pressure injection technique:
<img alt="spray_needle_1_2" src="../images/injection/spray_needle_1_2.png">
<em>(1) Needles enters the meat without spraying brine, (2) needles continoue al the way to the bottom without spraying</em></p>
<p><img alt="spray_needle_3_4" src="../images/injection/spray_needle_3_4.png">
<em>(3) Brine is spayed using high pressure from all holes, (4) Needles are withdrawn without spraying brine</em></p>
<p>The efficacy of the technology has not been verified independently yet</p>

<h2>Possible improvements</h2>
<p>Here is a list of features that has the potential to improve speed, quality and knowledge of the product in general. Some of the features already exist in available machines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed<ul>
<li>Increased injection cadence</li>

</ul>
<p>To text:
- Injection into meat that contain bones, areas of fat or cartilage
    * Meat that contain bones will break needles and pockets of brine can form around the bone
    * Areas with concentrations of fat or other non-meat tissues should not be injected with brine
- Achieving a uniform distribution of brine quickly
    * Multiple process steps and a lot of time is required to insure a satisfactory result
    * Individual and local differences in meat's abilities to absorb the brine are not taken into account</p>
<h3>Measuring quality of injection</h3>
<p>In order to do optimization a method for determining the quality of the salting is necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>CT scanning, use contrast fluid if necessary</li>
<li>Slice and photograph, use contrast fluid if necessary</li>
<li>Injection of salt-meter electrodes to sample salinity</li>
<li>Local increase in weight/volume</li>
<li>Drip loss/non-absorbed brine</li>
<li>(Uniform external color change)</li>
<li>(Firmness of meat)</li>
</ul>
