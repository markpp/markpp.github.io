    <h1>Adaptive brine injection</h1>
<p>Brine injection is selected as the basis for a "quick and dirty" project where an adaptive method will help achieve a more optimal addition of salt to meat products. The project's duration is confined to 3-4 month, this means that it is necessary to clearly deliminate the problem and make wide use of "hand held" solutions in order to reduce setup time and quickly test the adaptive method. The adaptiveness lies in measuring the input or the output and controlling the process parameters accordingly.</p>

<h1>Process description</h1>
<p>Brine is added to a wide range of meats before packaging in order to mature and tenderize the meat as well as enhance flavor. The brine consists of water and a mix of salt, phosphate, nitrate, sugar or flavoring. The central ingredient is the salt, which has the effect of increases the solubility of proteins and thereby improve the meats ability to retain water. However, if the salt concentration gets too high, the effect is reversed and the muscle fibers shrink and proteins risk getting washed out. For the best results, the brine should be uniformly distributed throughout the meat. This can be achieved by administering the brine externally or by injecting it directly into the meat. The salt will then diffuse through the meat and distribute evenly, with time, through chemical processes. Salt is able to diffuse at the most 0.5-1 cm. per day, so if the brine needs to defuse over long distances, it becomes very time intensive and impractical for modern industrial processes.
The standard practice for quickly curing meat is injection of brine using a battery of needles. Even with modern injection systems the results are not always satisfactory and the meat is subjected to additional treatments. This extra treatment can happen both before and after the injection of brine. For instance, meat's ability to absorb brine can be improved by hammering before injection, this extends the muscle fibers, which increase room for brine and help achieve a more even distribution. Similarly, accelerated and improved diffusion of the injected brine along with additional absorption can be achieved by further mechanical treatment post-injection. The meat is e.g. massaged, which helps drain pockets of brine and close holes left by the injection needles.</p>
<p>The rapport "Accelereret saltning med multistiksprøjtning" [2] from the the DMRI project; "Optimeret produktion af forædlede kødprodukter" investigates the possibilities for reducing the time needed to salt products using existing equipment. The process can be helped along by treating the meat mechanically. Advanced machinery exists for both injection and mechanical treatment, but no single manufacturer provides a complete state-of-the-art solution and slaughterhouses largely rely on older outdated machinery. The goal of part of the project is to reduce the time needed for the process to under one work day(7 hours).</p>
<h2>Process parameters</h2>
<p>The process can be be very complex when taking the natural variation of the meat and the process variables into account.</p>
<h3>The salting process</h3>
<p>The main process variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-injection mechanical preparation<ul>
<li>The degree to which the muscle fibers are stretched/loosened/opened</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Injection pattern<ul>
<li>Denseness of injection, i.e. the spacing between injection holes</li>
<li>Strategy for injecting brine, e.g. continuously, on the down stroke, when reaching the bottom, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brine injection pressure<ul>
<li>Brine pressure through the individual needle holes depends on the flow through other holes, which maybe be blocked or completely uncovered. High pressure has proven effective at better distributing the brine. Too high pressure may result in irreparable damage to the meat, where the meat disintegrates when sliced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Injection speed/time<ul>
<li>Duration injecting brine into the meat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Post-injection mechanical treatment<ul>
<li>[Time spend tumbling]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Physical properties of the meat</h3>
<p>that may influence the salting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meat texture<ul>
<li>[Hardness and viscosity tells us something about the room around muscle fibers and thereby the meats ability to absorb the brine]</li>
<li>State of muscle fibers e.i. the degree to which the fibers are prepared to absorb the brine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Size and shape<ul>
<li>Especially the height of the meat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Composition<ul>
<li>Bone, skin, fat and connective tissue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Muscle type<ul>
<li>Red muscle is more absorbent than white</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chemical properties of the brine and meat</h3>
<p>The composition of the brine solution and the chemical properties of the meat effect the salting. The most important chemical variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salt concentration<ul>
<li>Water retention increases with the concentration of salt</li>
<li>Very high salt concentrations reverses the effect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type of salt<ul>
<li><em>NaCl</em> is significantly better than <em>KCl</em> at increasing water retention</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sugar concentration<ul>
<li>Sugar has a similar effect to salt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phosphate concentration<ul>
<li>Phosphate increases the pH and water retention</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pH<ul>
<li>pH decides which ion, <em>Na+</em> or <em>Cl-</em>, plays the primary role in increasing water retention</li>
<li>A pH value around 6 has shown to lead to optimal water retention when using <em>NaCl</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Temperature<ul>
<li>Low temperature contributes to better water retention, 4&deg; being optimal</li>
<li>High temperature speeds up the diffusion of salt through the meat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type of meat<ul>
<li>Amount of protein and the ratios between protein types, e.g. intracellular(soluble) and extracellular(non-soluble), has an effect on the meats ability to retain water</li>
<li>pH difference between cuts , e.g. pork shoulder has a much higher pH than pork loin</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Initial experiment</h1>
<p>An initial experiment was conducted in order to investigate the effect of the two primary process parameters; brine pressure and injection speed, as well as determine the possibilities for visually measuring the gain using 3D sensing. The details of the experiment are described in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1raAamsBv-Zgsb5480L5EoHYvCk8Xo8ZGO3J60A4G6CI">multistiksprøjte eksperiment</a>.</p>
<h1>State-of-the-art</h1>
<p>Examples of some of the most advanced machines and research.</p>
<h2>Meat preparation</h2>
<p>The effectiveness of mechanical preparation of meat is not yet well documented or understood. Some of the leading products for mechanical preparation of meat before injection of brine are:</p>
<h3>STEAKER/PRESSES by Günther (DE)</h3>
<p>These machines enlarges the surface area of meat cutting or pressing the meat.</p>
<p><img alt="Günther (DE)" src="../images/injection/streaker_presses.jpg"></p>
<h3>MAX by Schröder (DE)</h3>
<p>Massages the meat in a temperature controlled environment, with or without vacuum.</p>
<p><img alt="Schröder (DE)" src="../images/injection/max_6000.jpg"></p>
<h3>TwinHammer 5500 by METALQUIMIA</h3>
<p>Pre-massaging unit that stretch the muscle fibers, which increase the space around fibrils. Leads to a reduction in the time needed for tumbling after injection.</p>

<h3>Bladehammer 5500 by METALQUIMIA</h3>

<h2>Brine injection</h2>
<p>In the meat industry, brine is most commonly added using machines with multiple injection needles, the number of needles typically ranges from 40 to 500 with a spacing of 12-25 mm. With the trend going towards many thin needles with a high number of small holes combined with high pressure.</p>
<p>Correct adjustment of the injector has a large impact on the time needed for the salt to properly diffuse. [3]</p>
<h3>IMAX 420 by Schröder (DE):</h3>
<p>Schröder offers integrated weights that automatically control and adapt the injection speed during operation. They also offer individual needle damage and flow detection. Their injection system rely on many and very thin needles as well as independent control of conveyor belt, which allows for a very dense injection pattern</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzfrEysbKYs"><img alt="Schröder (DE)" src="../images/injection/IMAX_420.png"></a></p>
<h3>PI 750 DUO by Günther (DE)</h3>
<p>Spray Plus
Traditionally, brine is injected using needles with a few holes that has a diameter above 1 mm and a low brine pressure of a few bars. With the spray plus system, Günther introduces a spray system where the needles have many holes with a small diameter and a very high brine pressure. This results in very fine droplets that should distribute well in the meat. Because of the much improved distribution of brine, the drip loss is reduced significantly.</p>
<p>The classical low pressure injection technique:</p>
<p><img alt="classic_needle_1_2_3_4" src="../images/injection/classic_needle_1_2_3_4.png"></p>
<p><em>(1) Brine injection from the start, (2) Spraying continous as the needles descend, (3) Needles reach the bottom and leaves pockets of brine, (4) As the needles are withdrawn, brine collects in the holes</em></p>
<p><img alt="classic_needle_5" src="../images/injection/classic_needle_5.png"></p>
<p><em>(5) As the needles leave the meat, brine will escape</em></p>
<p>The new high pressure injection technique:</p>
<p><img alt="spray_needle_1_2_3_4" src="../images/injection/spray_needle_1_2_3_4.png"></p>
<p><em>(1) Needles enters the meat without spraying brine, (2) needles continue al the way to the bottom without spraying, (3) Brine is spayed using high pressure from all holes, (4) Needles are withdrawn without spraying brine</em></p>
<p>The efficacy of the technology has not been verified independently yet</p>

<h2>Tumbling</h2>
<p>The diffusion of salt is helped along by the use of mechanical tumbling, which quickly can distribute the salt up to 2 cm. [3]
The meat is gently tumbled, resulting in a massage of the meat that helps drain unabsorbed brine and thereby avoiding pockets of brine as well as closing up the holes that are left from the injection.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Project choices</h1>
<p>To move forward with the project it is necessary to decide on a limited number of ideas to proceed with and perform initial experimentation that can help determine their potential.</p>
<h2>Predicting brine absorption</h2>
<p>Possible techniques for determining meat properties that correlate with the ability to absorb brine and which, therefore can be used to predicting optimal process parameters for the individual pieces of meat and local areas as well.
- Visual detection of red and white muscles
- Haptic measurement of muscle firmness
- Weight and size</p>
<h2>Process optimization</h2>
<p>Ideas for adjusting the process between product types, individual pieces of meat and even locally.
- Adjust injection pattern
- Injection strategy
- Injection pressure
- Injection speed(time)</p>
<h2>Measuring quality of salting</h2>
<p>In order to evaluate the prospective system and as feedback to the optimization method, it is necessary to find an appropriate and effective technique for determining the quality of the salting. The techniques are grouped in real-time appropriate and delayed techniques. The real-time methods are preferred because they can be automated and can provide direct feedback to a potential control loop. The delayed techniques are time consuming and are only appropriate for system calibration and evaluation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time<ul>
<li>Ultrasound image</li>
<li>Injection of salt-meter electrodes to sample salinity</li>
<li>Local increase in weight/volume</li>
<li>Measure firmness -&gt; texture [4]</li>

<li>CT scanning, use contrast fluid if necessary</li>
<li>Slice and photograph, use contrast fluid if necessary</li>

<h2>Platform</h2>
<p>There are two platforms that the project could potentially be based on. The first, is the type of dedicated machine that is currently used in the production out in the slaughterhouses. The alternative is mounting needles on a industrial robot arm, which at least initially is thought of as an experimentation platform.</p>
<h3>Dedicated injector</h3>
<p>Industrial multi-injectors have roughly looked the same for half a century. A large box build around a conveyor belt with rows of injection needles that are raised up and down while the conveyor belts moves the meat forward. An example, although very old, is available to be used and modified for this project. Depending on the ambition of the project, the machine needs to under extensive reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>"Chip-tuning"</strong> of existing multi-injection machine
The use of an industrial dedicated multi-injection machine has a number of potential benefits and disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Proven</li>
<li>Availability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Not easily modified</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some special features of this type of solution could be:
- Automation of process parameters using feedback from weighing before and after injection
- Automatic switching between recipes based on detection of meat type
- Adjustment of injection parameters across meat piece according to each end's ability to absorb brine</p>
<p><img alt="Advanced_chip-tuning" src="../images/injection/advanced_chip-tuning.png"></p>
<h3>Robot cell injector</h3>
<p>The use of an industrial robot for injection has a number of potential benefits and disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptability to product variation, e.g. size, bone-in</li>
<li>Smaller footprint -&gt; more freedom in placement</li>
<li>Multipurpose -&gt; high utilization, redundancy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Unproven</li>
<li>Lower throughput(maybe)</li>
<li>New needle tool necessary</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some special features of this type of solution could be:
- Local injection of brine followed by weighing in order to determine local gain
- Highly customized injection patterns
- High flexibility in application
- Automatic needle cleaning and switching</p>
<p><img alt="Local injection experiment" src="../images/injection/local_injection_experiment.png"></p>
<h1>Hypothesis</h1>
<p>First of, the purpose of the solution is to achieve an equal or better distribution of salt in the product in less time than with conventional equipment.</p>
<p>Below are a handful of hypothesis for how to achieve this goal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By letting a learning algorithm explore injection strategies it is possible to achieve a faster and more uniformly distributed salting.</p>
<p>It is possible to identify the individual meat piece's ability to absorb brine and adapt the injection parameters accordingly</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same but for local areas of the same piece of meat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it possible to measure to gain visually with a significant precision(what should this be?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same but for local areas of the same piece of meat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the optimal process parameters for each type of meat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grid search for investigating interactions between parameters
Classifier learns the correlation and predicts result</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it possible to predict the optimal process parameters for the individual pieces of meat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same but for local areas of the same piece of meat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it possible to find features that allow for to capture the variation in individual pieces of meats?</p>
<p>Is it possible to distinguish between red and white meat fibers visually?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Process optimization<ul>
<li>Optimal preparation of meat for uniform salt distribution</li>
<li>Optimal injection for uniform salt distribution</li>
<li>Optimal post injection processing</li>
